Despite the MINOR version bump, this is a small release that adds no user
visible functionality. Instead, it removes most of the legacy functionality that
we'll be trimming out soon and abstracts that into a separate classroom_legacy
module. Existing functionality is 100% maintained via shim classes, so unless
things break, there should be no visible changes at all.

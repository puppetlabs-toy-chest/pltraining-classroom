## site.pp ##

# This file ($environment/manifests/site.pp) is the main entry point used
# when an agent connects to a master and asks for an updated configuration.
#
# Global objects like filebuckets and resource defaults should go in this file,
# as should the default node definition. (The default node can be omitted
# if you use the console and don't define any other nodes in site.pp. See
# http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/language_guide.html#nodes for more on
# node definitions.)

# This will ensure that all agents in the classroom, including containers, will
# collect all classroom exported host records. The bargain-basement DNS!

# DEFAULT NODE
# Node definitions in this file are merged with node data from the console. See
# http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/language_guide.html#nodes for more on
# node definitions.

# The default node definition matches any node lacking a more specific node
# definition. If there are no other nodes in this file, classes declared here
# will be included in every node's catalog, *in addition* to any classes
# specified in the console for that node.

node default {
  # This is where you can declare classes for all nodes.
  # Example:
  #   class { 'my_class': }
  include role::classroom
}
